""" Rohith is a data analyst who needs to categorize countries based on their population growth rates. Each country is assigned a unique code. Rohith will receive a code and corresponding data based on the code. If the data falls within specific thresholds, he needs to classify the countryâ€™s priority level. 



Your task is to write a program that reads a country code and its associated data, and then determines if the priority is "High" or "Low."



Thresholds:
France: Priority is "High" if the percentage < 50, else "Low".
Japan: Priority is "High" if life expectancy > 80, else "Low".
Brazil: Priority is "High" if the urban population > 80, else "Low".
Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer, representing the country code (1 for France, 2 for Japan, 3 for Brazil).

If the country code is 1,

The second line consists of a floating-point value N, representing the percentage of the English-speaking population.
If the country code is 2,

The second line consists of a floating-point value A, representing the average life expectancy in years.
If the country code is 3,

The second line consists of a floating-point value P, representing the percentage of the urban population.
Output format :
The first line of output displays "Priority: High" or "Priority: Low" based on the input data.

If the country code is invalid, print "Invalid"."""
